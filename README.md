Hello, im working on a token generator, and i want to make less easy to detect my browser as fake
So i tried to make fake moves by not teleporting, but this is still not good !
I tried to install this puppeteer module but it doesn't want to work !
https://www.npmjs.com/package/ghost-cursor
Could anyone use this code to simply make an array of coordinates to do.
Then i can simply look then and make the same movements !
